to do // final project in dsa

first, add main menu: 1.register, 2.login, 3.admin login (edit item stocks, price, name), 4. exit 

---------------------------------
in registeruser function:

username should be at least 4 char
password should be at least 8 char
phone number should be exactly 11 digits (will be called out as e-wallet number for the receipt)
address (will be called out as delivery place for the receipt)
user balance will be initialized to 0

user details will be saved in a txt file so that they are saved even when program ended
then goes back to main menu
---------------------------------
userlogin function:
standard login process

then proceed to usermenu function:

usermenu function will have 6 options
1. add to cart 
- upon clicking this, the user will be shown the 5 food categories
  burgers, fries, salads, drinks, deserts

when the user has chosen the category, they will be shown again the items in that category.
then after choosing a specific item, they will be asked how many quantiy of that then it will be added to their cart.
 
2. edit cart (can delete item in cart or edit quantity of their items.
3. top-up (top up and updates user balance)
4. view cart and place order (confirms order, handles transaction process, then gives out the receipt)
5. check credentials (gives a print out of the users' password, phone num, address, and balance, but ill take care of this)
6. logout (goes back to main menu, if user has items in their cart, they will be gone when upon logging out)
---------------------------------
//adminmenu function:
admin username is fixed as "admin"
admin password is fixed as "adminpass"
after logging in, admin will go to adminupdate function

//adminupdate function: 
upon logging in of admin, admin can choose whether to 
1. edit number of item stocks
2. edit price of an item
3. edit item name
(last number to go back to main menu)


upon choosing, each category will be shown its own menu, for example we have 5 categories
1. burgers
2. fries
3. salads
4. drinks
5. deserts
(last number to go back to admin update)

then if admin chose a menu they will see items with its name, quantity, and price
each item should have its index, name, stocks, and price, so the data structure to be used here must be flexible

ex.(for burger category)
=========================================
   item       STOCKS    PRICE
1. burger1      10      $10.00 
2. burger2      10      $10.00 
and so on...
=========================================
choose item number to edit stocks/price/name (depending on what the admin chose to update earlier in adminupdate function)
enter the updated stocks/price/name (depending on what the admin chose to update earlier in adminupdate function): 

then goes back to adminmenu function


---------------------------------------
and last option in the main menu is just exit which terminates the whole program.
